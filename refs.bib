abstract = {This paper deals with a fault-tolerant semi-12-phase permanent-magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) used for electric vehicles. High fault-tolerant and low toque ripple features are achieved by employing fractional slot concentrated windings (FSCWs) and open windings. Excessive magnetomotive force (MMF) harmonic components can lead to thermal demagnetization of rotor magnets as well as high core loss. An improved all-teeth-wound winding disposition that changes the winding factor of each harmonic is applied to suppress harmonics. A relatively large slot leakage inductance that limits the short-circuit current (SCC) induced in the short-circuited winding is proposed to deal with short-circuit fault. Fault-tolerant controls up to two phases open circuited are investigated in this paper based on keeping the same torque-producing MMF. The fault-tolerant control strategies corresponding to each faulty mode are studied and compared to ensure high performance operation.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a six-phase fault-tolerant modular permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) with a novel 24-slot/14-pole combination is proposed as a high-performance actuator for wheel-driving electric vehicle (EV) applications. Feasible slot/pole combinations of the fractional-slot concentrated winding six-phase PMSM are elicited and analyzed for scheme selection. The novel 24-slot/14-pole combination is derived from the analysis and suppression of the magnetomotive force (MMF) harmonics. By making use of alternate-teeth-wound concentrated winding configuration, two adjacent coils per phase and unequal teeth widths, the phase windings of the proposed machine is magnetically, thermally isolated, which offers potentials of modular design and fault tolerant capability. Taking advantage of the leakage component of winding inductance, 1.0 per unit short-circuit current is achieved endowing the machine with short-circuit proof capability. Optimal design of essential parameters aiming at low eddy current losses, high winding factor and short-circuit-proof ability are presented to pave the way for a high-quality system implementation.},
